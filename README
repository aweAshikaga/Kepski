This is an unfinished top-down space shooter written with Python and Pygame.
You can shoot enemies who have two different behaviours and you can collect life-powerUps.
The programm keeps track of your lives but you cannot die at this point.

If it is useful in any way for you, feel free to do what ever you want with this code.
